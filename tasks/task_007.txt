# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Data Deduplication Service
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a service to detect and handle duplicate blood glucose readings during data ingestion.
# Details:
1. Create a deduplication service:
   ```python
   class DeduplicationService:
       def __init__(self, db_client):
           self.db_client = db_client
       
       async def process_reading(self, reading: GlucoseReading) -> Tuple[GlucoseReading, bool]:
           # Check if reading already exists
           existing = await self.db_client.get_reading(
               user_id=reading.user_id,
               timestamp=reading.timestamp
           )
           
           if not existing:
               # No duplicate, return original
               return reading, False
           
           # Implement conflict resolution strategy
           if self._should_replace(existing, reading):
               # Update the existing reading with new data
               updated = self._merge_readings(existing, reading)
               return updated, True
           
           # Keep existing, mark as duplicate
           return existing, True
       
       def _should_replace(self, existing: Dict, new: GlucoseReading) -> bool:
           # Logic to determine if new reading should replace existing
           # For example, prefer readings with more complete data
           return new.created_at > existing["created_at"]
       
       def _merge_readings(self, existing: Dict, new: GlucoseReading) -> GlucoseReading:
           # Logic to merge data from existing and new readings
           # Keep the best data from both
           merged = GlucoseReading(**existing)
           # Update with new data as appropriate
           merged.updated_at = datetime.utcnow()
           return merged
   ```

2. Implement conflict resolution strategies
3. Add tracking and logging of deduplication events
4. Create batch deduplication for multiple readings
5. Optimize database queries for deduplication checks
6. Implement metrics for deduplication rate

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for deduplication logic
2. Test conflict resolution with various scenarios
3. Integration tests with database for actual deduplication
4. Verify logging of deduplication events
5. Performance testing for batch deduplication
6. Test edge cases (identical readings, slightly different readings)
