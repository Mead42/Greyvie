   ```python
   class SyncService:
       def __init__(
           self,
           dexcom_client_factory,
           token_service,
           db_client,
           validation_service,
           deduplication_service
       ):
           self.dexcom_client_factory = dexcom_client_factory
           self.token_service = token_service
           self.db_client = db_client
           self.validation_service = validation_service
           self.deduplication_service = deduplication_service
       
       async def sync_user_data(self, user_id: str, start_date: datetime, end_date: datetime) -> SyncResult:
           # Get user tokens
           tokens = await self.token_service.get_user_tokens(user_id)
           if not tokens or tokens.is_expired():
               if tokens and tokens.refresh_token:
                   # Try to refresh token
                   tokens = await self.token_service.refresh_tokens(user_id, tokens.refresh_token)
               else:
                   raise AuthenticationError(f"No valid tokens for user {user_id}")
           
           # Create Dexcom client
           client = self.dexcom_client_factory.create_client(tokens.access_token)
           
           # Fetch readings
           raw_readings = await client.get_glucose_readings(start_date, end_date)
           
           # Process readings
           results = SyncResult(total=len(raw_readings))
           
           for raw in raw_readings:
               try:
                   # Add user_id to raw data
                   raw["user_id"] = user_id
                   
                   # Validate and normalize
                   reading = await self.validation_service.process_reading(raw)
                   
                   # Check for duplicates
                   reading, is_duplicate = await self.deduplication_service.process_reading(reading)
                   
                   if is_duplicate:
                       results.duplicates += 1
                   else:
                       # Store in database
                       await self.db_client.store_reading(reading)
                       results.stored += 1
               except ValidationError as e:
                   results.validation_errors += 1
                   logger.warning(f"Validation error for reading: {e}")
               except Exception as e:
                   results.errors += 1
                   logger.error(f"Error processing reading: {e}")
           
           return results
   ```

2. Implement scheduler using asyncio or APScheduler:
   - Configure polling interval from environment
   - Add jitter to prevent API thundering herd
   - Track and log polling metrics

3. Create distributed locking mechanism to prevent duplicate processing
4. Implement sync job tracking in DynamoDB
5. Add error handling and retry logic for failed syncs
6. Create metrics for sync job success/failure rates

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for sync service with mocked dependencies
2. Integration tests for full sync workflow
3. Test scheduler with various intervals
4. Verify distributed locking prevents duplicate processing
5. Test error handling and retry logic
6. Verify metrics collection for sync jobs
7. Test with large datasets to ensure performance

# Subtasks:

## 2. Develop Scheduler Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a flexible scheduling system to manage sync jobs at configured intervals

Implement a scheduler using a library like Quartz or native scheduling mechanisms. Support cron expressions for flexible scheduling. Include configuration for different sync types with different schedules. Write tests for schedule triggering, overlap prevention, and schedule modification during runtime.

## 3. Implement Distributed Locking Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a robust distributed locking system to prevent concurrent sync operations
### Details:
Implement distributed locking using Redis, ZooKeeper, or a database-based approach. Include lock acquisition with timeouts, automatic lock release mechanisms, and deadlock prevention. Test with simulated concurrent processes, lock expiration scenarios, and system failure during lock holding.

## 4. Develop Error Handling and Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling with intelligent retry mechanisms
### Details:
Create a retry framework with exponential backoff. Categorize errors as retriable vs. non-retriable. Implement circuit breaker pattern for external system failures. Test with simulated network failures, API timeouts, and various error responses from target systems.

## 5. Create Sync Job Tracking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.4
### Description: Develop a system to track and report on sync job status and history
### Details:
Implement a database schema for tracking sync jobs with status, timestamps, affected record counts, and error details. Create APIs to query job status and history. Include dashboards for monitoring. Test with long-running jobs, failed jobs, and historical data retrieval.

## 6. Implement Metrics Collection [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.5
### Description: Add comprehensive metrics collection for monitoring and performance analysis
### Details:
Integrate with metrics library (Micrometer, StatsD, etc.). Track sync duration, record counts, error rates, and system resource usage. Set up alerting thresholds. Test metrics accuracy under load, correct aggregation of metrics, and alerting functionality.

## 7. Optimize Performance for Large Datasets [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 8.6
### Description: Enhance the sync service to efficiently handle large volumes of data
### Details:
Implement batching and pagination strategies. Add parallel processing capabilities. Optimize memory usage with streaming approaches. Create performance tests with varying data volumes, measure throughput and resource utilization, and test with realistic production-like datasets.
