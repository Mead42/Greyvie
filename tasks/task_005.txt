           self.client = httpx.AsyncClient(
               base_url=base_url,
               headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}
           )
           self.rate_limiter = RateLimiter(max_calls=100, period=60)  # 100 calls per minute
       
       async def get_glucose_readings(self, start_date: datetime, end_date: datetime) -> List[Dict]:
           async with self.rate_limiter:
               endpoint = "/v2/users/self/egvs"
               params = {
                   "startDate": start_date.isoformat(),
                   "endDate": end_date.isoformat()
               }
               
               response = await self.client.get(endpoint, params=params)
               
               if response.status_code == 429:  # Rate limited
                   retry_after = int(response.headers.get("Retry-After", 60))
                   await asyncio.sleep(retry_after)
                   return await self.get_glucose_readings(start_date, end_date)

# Subtasks:
## 1. Basic Dexcom API Client Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core API client structure with authentication, request handling, and response parsing
### Details:
Create a client class with methods for authentication (OAuth2), endpoint configuration, HTTP request methods (GET, POST, etc.), response parsing, error handling for common HTTP errors, and data model classes for Dexcom API responses. Include unit tests for successful authentication, basic requests, and error responses.

## 2. Rate Limiting Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Add rate limiting capabilities to prevent API quota exhaustion
### Details:
Implement token bucket algorithm for rate limiting, configure limits based on Dexcom API documentation, add request queuing mechanism when approaching limits, implement rate limit detection from API responses, and add backpressure handling. Write tests for rate limit detection, request throttling behavior, and queue management.

## 3. Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement intelligent retry logic for transient failures
### Details:
Create a retry strategy with exponential backoff and jitter, categorize errors as retryable vs. non-retryable, implement maximum retry attempts configuration, add timeout handling, and ensure idempotency for retried operations. Test retry behavior with mocked transient failures, timeout scenarios, and maximum retry exhaustion.

## 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3
### Description: Add circuit breaker to prevent cascading failures during API outages
### Details:
Implement circuit breaker states (closed, open, half-open), configure failure thresholds and recovery timeouts, add state transition logic, implement fallback mechanisms for when circuit is open, and ensure thread-safety. Test circuit state transitions, fallback behavior, and recovery scenarios.

## 5. Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Implement detailed logging and monitoring capabilities
### Details:
Add structured logging for all API operations, implement request/response logging with PII redaction, create performance metrics collection (latency, error rates, etc.), add correlation IDs for request tracing, and implement configurable log levels. Test log output for different scenarios, verify PII redaction, and validate metrics collection.

## 6. Structured Logging Foundation [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Establish a consistent, structured logging setup for the Dexcom API client. Integrate Python’s logging module (or structlog), define log format (JSON or key-value), set up log levels, ensure logs include timestamp, log level, module, and message. Add unit tests to verify log output format and level filtering.
### Details:
- Integrate Python’s logging module (or structlog for richer structure)
- Define log format (JSON or key-value pairs) for easy parsing
- Set up log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and allow configuration via environment or client options
- Ensure all logs include timestamp, log level, module, and message
- Add unit tests to verify log output format and level filtering

## 7. Request/Response Logging with PII Redaction [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Log all API requests and responses, ensuring no sensitive data (PII) is exposed. Implement middleware or wrapper to log outgoing requests and incoming responses, redact PII fields, and log request method, URL, status code, latency, and response size. Add tests to verify PII is never logged and logs contain required metadata.
### Details:
- Implement middleware or wrapper in the client to log outgoing requests and incoming responses
- Identify and redact PII fields (e.g., tokens, user IDs, glucose values if required)
- Log request method, URL, status code, latency, and response size
- Add tests to verify PII is never logged and that logs contain required metadata

## 8. Correlation IDs and Request Tracing [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Enable tracing of requests across logs for debugging and monitoring. Generate a unique correlation/request ID for each API call, propagate through all logs, and allow passing a correlation ID from upstream. Add tests to ensure correlation IDs are present and consistent in logs.
### Details:
- Generate a unique correlation/request ID for each API call (UUID4)
- Propagate correlation ID through all logs related to a single request
- Optionally, allow passing a correlation ID from upstream (for integration with larger systems)
- Add tests to ensure correlation IDs are present and consistent in logs

## 9. Performance Metrics Collection [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Track and expose key performance metrics for the client. Measure and record API call latency, error rates, and success rates. Track rate limit events, retries, and circuit breaker state changes. Use a metrics library or simple stats collector. Provide a way to export or query metrics. Add tests to verify metrics are collected and reported accurately.
### Details:
- Measure and record API call latency, error rates, and success rates
- Track rate limit events, retries, and circuit breaker state changes
- Use a metrics library (e.g., prometheus_client) or a simple in-memory/exportable stats collector
- Provide a way to export or query metrics (e.g., via a method or endpoint)
- Add tests to verify metrics are collected and reported accurately

## 10. Configurable Log Levels and Output Destinations [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
