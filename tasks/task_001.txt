# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with the required structure and dependencies for the BG Ingest Service.
# Details:
1. Create a new Python project using Poetry
2. Configure Python 3.11 as the required version
3. Add core dependencies:
   - FastAPI for API framework
   - Pydantic for data validation
   - Uvicorn for ASGI server
   - boto3 for AWS services
   - httpx for HTTP client
   - pika for RabbitMQ integration
4. Set up development dependencies:
   - pytest for testing
   - mypy for type checking
   - black and isort for formatting
   - flake8 for linting
5. Create Docker and Docker Compose files for containerization
6. Set up basic project structure:
   ```
   bg_ingest/
     ├── api/
     ├── auth/
     ├── data/
     ├── models/
     ├── services/
     ├── utils/
     └── main.py
   tests/
   ```
7. Configure CI pipeline with GitHub Actions

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify project structure is correctly set up
2. Ensure all dependencies can be installed
3. Confirm Docker container builds successfully
4. Validate development environment works with sample code
5. Test CI pipeline with a basic test case

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Git Repository and Project Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the Git repository and create the basic project structure with necessary configuration files.
### Details:
1. Create a new Git repository
2. Initialize project with Poetry (poetry init)
3. Create standard directories (src, tests, docs)
4. Add .gitignore file with appropriate patterns
5. Create README.md with project overview
6. Make initial commit

Acceptance Criteria:
- Repository initialized with proper .gitignore
- Poetry project initialized with pyproject.toml
- Basic directory structure in place
- README with project description and setup instructions

## 2. Configure Dependencies and Development Environment [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up project dependencies, development tools, and virtual environment configuration.
### Details:
1. Define core dependencies in pyproject.toml
2. Add development dependencies (pytest, black, isort, mypy, etc.)
3. Configure pre-commit hooks
4. Set up environment variable templates
5. Create developer setup documentation

Acceptance Criteria:
- All dependencies specified in pyproject.toml
- Development tools configured and documented
- Pre-commit hooks working for code quality checks
- Virtual environment creation process documented
- Poetry lock file generated

## 3. Create Docker Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up Docker and docker-compose files for containerized development and deployment.
### Details:
1. Create Dockerfile for the application
2. Create docker-compose.yml for local development
3. Configure volume mappings for development
4. Set up environment variable handling
5. Add Docker-specific documentation
6. Test Docker build and run processes

Acceptance Criteria:
- Dockerfile builds successfully
- docker-compose.yml includes all necessary services
- Container starts without errors
- Development environment works within container
- Documentation includes Docker usage instructions

## 4. Configure CI Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Set up continuous integration pipeline for automated testing and quality checks.
### Details:
1. Create CI configuration file (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
2. Configure test running in CI
3. Set up linting and type checking in CI
4. Configure Docker build testing
5. Add code coverage reporting
6. Set up branch protection rules

Acceptance Criteria:
- CI pipeline configuration committed to repository
- Pipeline runs on push and pull requests
- All tests, linting, and type checking run in CI
- Docker build tested in CI
- Code coverage reports generated
- Branch protection rules implemented
